# Sandbox
The sandbox is used as a simple environment that is set up for developers to start up a small react project easily.

## Requirements
Before you run anything in sandbox be sure that you already have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your system.

## Getting started
Take the following steps to get the app running on your local machine.

* Once you have cloned the repo, navigate to the `sandbox` folder.
* Next run the `npm install -g expo-cli` command
* Then run `npm install` to install the packages for the app
* From here you should be able to run `npm run start` to start the app

The expo app will open in a browser where you can test the app on your phone with the expo app installed
